    reviewText: "After 15 nights in this tent across various conditions, I can confidently recommend it for 3-season backpacking. Setup is intuitive and takes about 5 minutes. The freestanding design is great for rocky terrain. Ventilation is excellent - minimal condensation even in humid conditions. Pack size is reasonable at 3.7 lbs for a 2-person tent. Downsides: The floor fabric shows wear faster than expected, and the zippers can be finicky in cold weather. Overall, a solid choice for weekend warriors.",

Fuel efficiency is impressive. However, it is really only good for boiling water. You cannot simmer well, and the tall design makes it tippy on uneven ground. The igniter stopped working after 20 uses but the manual lighting works fine. Great for dehydrated meals and coffee, not ideal if you want to cook real food.",

The major downside is the crinkly noise - every time you move, it sounds like a chip bag. This can be annoying for light sleepers or if you are sharing a tent.

The squeeze bags that come with it are fragile - I replaced mine with a Smartwater bottle which threads on perfectly. At 3oz and under $40, this is the best value in water filtration. One filter will last you years if maintained properly. No chemicals, no waiting, just squeeze and drink.",
