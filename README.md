### My Campsite Profile System - Handle Bug Fixes & Navigation Cleanup

  - Create: Only signed-in users can create contacts with their own `ownerId`
  - Update/Delete: Only the owner can modify or delete their contacts
- **Important**: Firestore rules updated in `firestore.rules` but need manual deployment

- Hero titles (Bold)
- Section headers (SemiBold)
- Big titles (Bold)
- Feature landing screens (Bold)
- Illustrated pages
- Welcome screen titles
- Anything that carries the "WPA field guide" aesthetic

#### Body Font: Source Sans 3
**Weights Available:**
- `SourceSans3_400Regular`
- `SourceSans3_600SemiBold`
- `SourceSans3_700Bold`

**Use For:**
- Body text
- Labels
- Checklists
- Cards
- Buttons
- Navigation labels
- Paragraphs under section headings

#### Accent Font: Satisfy
**Weights Available:**
- `Satisfy_400Regular`

**Use For:**
- Very sparingly
- Never for functional UI
- Think tiny, decorative text when needed

#### Implementation Rules
**IMPORTANT:** Every `<Text>` element must specify one of these exact font families. No system font fallback is allowed.

**Typography Components** (recommended approach):
```typescript
import { Heading1, Heading2, SectionTitle, BodyText, Caption } from "../components/Typography";

// Display fonts
<Heading1>Welcome to Camping</Heading1>  // JosefinSlab_700Bold
<SectionTitle>Getting Started</SectionTitle>  // JosefinSlab_600SemiBold

// Body fonts
<BodyText>This is regular body text</BodyText>  // SourceSans3_400Regular
<Caption>Small caption text</Caption>  // SourceSans3_400Regular
```

**Direct Text Usage** (when typography components can't be used):
```typescript
<Text style={{ fontFamily: "SourceSans3_400Regular" }}>Regular text</Text>
<Text style={{ fontFamily: "SourceSans3_600SemiBold" }}>Semibold text</Text>
<Text style={{ fontFamily: "JosefinSlab_700Bold" }}>Bold display text</Text>
```

### UI Components

- **Button** - 4 variants (primary, secondary, outline, ghost), 3 sizes
- **Typography** - Consistent text styles
- **Cards** - Rounded corners, subtle borders, active states
- **Haptic feedback** - On all interactive elements
- **Icons** - Ionicons throughout

## 🛠 State Management

### Zustand Stores with Persistence

**tripsStore.ts** - Comprehensive trip management
```typescript
- trips: Trip[]
- addTrip() - Returns trip ID
- updateTrip()
- deleteTrip()
- getTripById()
- getTripsByStatus()
- updateTripPacking() - Track gear progress
- updateTripMeals() - Meal planning
- updateTripNotes() - Trip journal
- updateTripWeather() - Store forecast data
```

**tripsListStore.ts** - Trip list UI state (persisted)
```typescript
- segment: "active" | "completed" | "all"
- sortBy: "startSoonest" | "updatedRecent" | "az"
- filters: { dateFrom, dateTo, campingStyle, states }
- pageBySegment: Record<segment, page>
- setSegment(), setSortBy(), setFilters()
- resetFilters(), incrementPage(), resetPaging()
```

**learningStore.ts** - Learning progression
```typescript
- modules: LearningModule[]
- tracks: LearningTrack[]
- userProgress: { level, xp, completedModules }
- completeModule() - Award XP
- getModulesByTrack()
- canAccessModule() - Check unlock status
```

**gearStore.ts** - Packing lists
```typescript
- packingLists: PackingList[]
- addPackingList()
- updatePackingList()
- deletePackingList()
- toggleItemPacked()
- getPackingProgress()
```

**parksStore.ts** - Parks discovery
```typescript
- parks: Park[]
- filteredParks: Park[]
- filters: { types, state, searchQuery }
- setParks()
- setFilters()
- clearFilters()
```

**mealStore.ts** - Meal library and filtering
```typescript
- mealLibrary: MealLibraryItem[] (100+ pre-populated meals)
- selectedCategory: "all" | "breakfast" | "lunch" | "dinner" | "snack"
- selectedPrepType: "all" | "noCook" | "cold" | "campStove" | "campfire"
- searchQuery: string
- setSelectedCategory()
- setSelectedPrepType()
- setSearchQuery()
- getFilteredMeals() - Returns filtered meals based on all filters
- addCustomMeal() - Add user's custom meals
- initializeMealLibrary() - Populates library on first load
```

### Best Practices Used
✅ Individual selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders
✅ AsyncStorage persistence for trips and gear
✅ Immutable state updates
✅ Type-safe actions and selectors

## 📱 Navigation Structure

```
RootNavigator (Stack)
└── HomeTabs (Bottom Tabs)
    ├── Home
    ├── MyTrips
    ├── Parks
    └── GearLists

Modal Screens (presentation: modal)
├── CreateTrip
└── CreateGearList

Detail Screens
├── TripDetail
├── ParkDetail
├── GearListDetail
└── Account
```

## 🔧 Key Improvements Over Original

### 1. State Management
**Before**: 21 different stores, potential for over-subscription
**After**: 3 optimized stores with selective subscriptions

### 2. Code Organization
**Before**: Mixed concerns, unclear structure
**After**: Clear separation - components, screens, state, navigation

### 3. Type Safety
**Before**: Inconsistent typing
**After**: Full TypeScript with strict types

### 4. Performance
**Before**: Unnecessary re-renders, bloated code
**After**: Optimized selectors, clean code, efficient updates

### 5. UI Consistency
**Before**: Inconsistent styling and patterns
**After**: Design system with reusable components

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Using Stores
```typescript
// ✅ Good - Selective subscription
const trips = useTripsStore((s) => s.trips);
const addTrip = useTripsStore((s) => s.addTrip);

// ❌ Bad - Subscribes to entire store
const store = useTripsStore();
```

### Creating a Trip
```typescript
addTrip({
  name: "Yosemite Weekend",
  startDate: new Date().toISOString(),
  endDate: new Date(Date.now() + 86400000 * 2).toISOString(),
  campingStyle: "backpacking",
  partySize: 4,
});
```

### Creating a Packing List
```typescript
const listId = addPackingList({
  name: "Weekend Camping",
  tripId: "trip_123",
  categories: GEAR_TEMPLATES,
});
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Ready to Implement
- Weather API integration (forecast display on trips)
- Map view for parks (react-native-maps is installed)
- Photo uploads for trip memories
- Notes and journal entries per trip
- Share packing lists
- Offline mode with better caching

### Easy Extensions
- More park filters (amenities, activities)
- Custom gear item creation
- Trip invitations and sharing
- Camping tips and guides
- Equipment reviews

## 📦 Dependencies

All required packages are already installed:
- **React Navigation** - Native stack, bottom tabs
- **Zustand** - State management with persistence
- **date-fns** - Date formatting
- **Nativewind** - Tailwind CSS for React Native
- **Expo** - Full Expo SDK 53
- **Haptics** - Native haptic feedback

## 🧪 Testing

The app structure makes testing easy:
- Pure functions in stores (easy to unit test)
- Component props are well-defined
- Navigation types prevent routing errors
- Mock data included for development

## 📝 Notes

### What Was Kept
- Your original feature set and vision
- The lodge/camping aesthetic
- Core functionality (trips, parks, gear)

### What Was Improved
- Architecture and organization
- State management efficiency
- Code cleanliness and maintainability
- Type safety
- UI consistency
- Performance

### What's Ready to Add
- Backend integration (Firebase, Supabase, etc.)
- Authentication
- Real park data (NPS API)
- Weather API
- Image uploads
- Social features

## 💡 Tips

1. **Adding new screens**: Add to `RootStackParamList` in `src/navigation/types.ts`
2. **New state**: Create a focused store in `src/state/`
3. **Reusable UI**: Add components to `src/components/`
4. **Styling**: Use Nativewind classes with lodge theme colors
5. **Icons**: Browse Ionicons at https://ionic.io/ionicons

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules

The following rules need to be manually added to your Firebase Console under Firestore Database → Rules.

### userGear Collection (My Gear Closet)

Add these rules to allow users to manage their personal gear:

```javascript
// My Gear Closet - private gear collection
match /userGear/{gearId} {
  allow read: if isSignedIn()
    && "ownerId" in resource.data
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;

  allow create: if isSignedIn()
    && "ownerId" in request.resource.data
    && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.ownerId;

  allow update, delete: if isSignedIn()
    && "ownerId" in resource.data
    && request.auth.uid == resource.data.ownerId;
}
```

**Storage Rules for Gear Photos:**

Add these rules to Firebase Storage under Storage → Rules:

```javascript
// Gear Closet images - users can only access their own gear photos
match /gearCloset/{userId}/{gearId}/{fileName} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  allow delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}
```

### How to Deploy Rules

1. Go to Firebase Console → Your Project
2. Navigate to **Firestore Database** → **Rules** tab
3. Add the `userGear` rules to your existing rules (inside the `service cloud.firestore` block)
4. Navigate to **Storage** → **Rules** tab
5. Add the `gearCloset` storage rules to your existing rules (inside the `service firebase.storage` block)
6. Click **Publish** to deploy the changes
